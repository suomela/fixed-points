# Periodic points in round elimination

Round elimination is a function "re" that turns a locally verifiable graph problem P into a new graph problem P' = re(P).

Sometimes round elimination leads to a fixed point, with P = re(P), or a periodic point, e.g., P = re(re(P)). Whenever this happens to a nontrivial problem P, we immediately get a lower bound for the distributed complexity of P. This repository is a catalog of such problems P.

Directory A-B-L:

- active degree A
- passive degree B
- L labels
- these problems are periodic points

Directory A-B-L-distance-D:

- active degree A
- passive degree B
- L labels
- D steps of round elimination leads to a periodic point
